# Starting at Flying Fish
I am sharing my experince and the road I paced as a starter in Flying Fish, hoping to pave the way for the next starters. 
Let me list the topics you need to know to fit more easily in your role.

- [Linux](#Linux)
- [Dropbox](#Dropbox)
- [Shell Scripting](#Shell_Scripting)
- [Docker](#Docker)
- Node.js

## Linux
You should have installed a distribution of Linux, preferably Ubuntu. You may also use a virtual machine on Windows, for example [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
Anyway, you need to know at least the basics of linux. You may watch this starter video of Brad Traversy here:
- [Linux Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBokz0LTizk)

## Dropbox
You should also install Dropbox desktop on your computer to sync your files with others. It can be done either in Windows or Linux.

## Shell_Scripting
It is useful to be able to read a Bash code. As a warning, I should emphasis that it is the ugliest programming language without ANY dispute. Brad has also a decent video about it.

## Docker
Probably the most mysterious thing to learn. I should have written my own perception about it, I will do it someday, but for now I just refer you to two nice videos. A short and a long introduction to Docker.
- [Short Intro to Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JprTjTViaEA)
- [Long Intro to Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo)

*The second video, has also some helpful [exercises](https://kodekloud.com/p/docker-labs) to do, you may check it out.*

## Node.js
Things are getting more serious and challenges are starting. I am not still sure about which aspects of Node you should know, but anyway I recomend these videos for now. I may change them when I get to know the system better.
