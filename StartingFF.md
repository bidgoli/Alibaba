I am sharing my experince and the road I paced as a starter in Flying Fish, hoping to pave the way for the next starters. 
Let me list the topics you need to know to fit more easily in your role.

- [Linux](#Linux)
- Dropbox
- Bash
- Docker
- Node.js

## Linux
You should have installed a distribution of Linux, preferably Ubuntu. You may also use a virtual machine on windows, for example [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
Anyway, you need to know at least the basics of linux. You may watch this starter video of Brad Traversy here:
